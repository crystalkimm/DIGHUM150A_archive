### April
- April 21, 2020 - [Refinery29 article about fast fashion](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9714553/coronavirus-effect-on-fast-fashion)
  - Fast fashion is something that I rarely think about because shopping for clothes at stores like Urban Outfitters seems so normal to me. I haven't been shopping much during quarantine, but when I return from my shopping hiatus, I hope to look into thrifting, renting, and buying second-hand items.

- April 29, 2020 - [Medium article on how Amazon is unethical](https://onezero.medium.com/its-now-100-unethical-to-shop-on-amazon-48d553181a6c)
  - I'll admit, I am an avid Amazon user; I can buy almost any product I want by tapping my screen, and I can expect it to arrive at my doorstep in about three days. It's convenient and a lot of items are cheaper or in bulk. While this all seems great, there is a harsh truth that Amazon mistreats their employees. There are some alternatives to Amazon to support (https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/amazon-alternatives), but even then, Amazon's prices tend to be unbeatable. It may be difficult to stop using Amazon, but I hope I will try to shop from alternatives so as to try to not actively support a company that has unethical practices.

### May
- May 19, 2020 - [Washington Post article about racism against Asian Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/19/asian-american-discrimination/)

- May 19, 2020 - [Environmental racism - COVID-19](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/environmental-racism-left-black-communities-especially-vulnerable-covid-19/?session=1)

### June
- June 8, 2020 - [Systemic vs Systematic racism](https://withoutbullshit.com/blog/systemic-vs-systematic-for-example-systemic-racism)

- June 29, 2020 - [NPR article on prison labor](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/29/884989263/the-uncounted-workforce)
  - Although recent discussion of prison labor sprouted from people learning about slavery, racism, and slave labor, this seems important to talk about regardless of race. It's important to note that companies that we buy from benefit from prison labor. This may compel you to stop supporting these companies and find alternative brands to shop. I have no discretion over other people's choice of consumption, but I believe it is important that we try to do more research and make more conscious decisions of what companies we support. This is an article explaining why these facts may be misleading: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/22/instagram-posts/instagram-post-shares-misleading-information-about/.


### July
- July 3, 2020 - [Facts and Myths about Hamilton](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9894557/hamilton-musical-real-history-facts)
![hamilton](/images/hamilton.jpg)
  - I saw this post before my sister got a Disney+ subscription (I was planning to watch the Hamilfilm). When I read this post, I felt it was informative but I had no context because I hadn't watched the film yet. Once I finished the musical, I looked back at this post, and understood why we need to fact check almost anything we see. Hamilton was written not only to educate people, but to make the audience want to learn more and see what is missing when such a complex story is told in under three hours. For anyone who has watched Hamilton and hasn't read about the facts and myths in the show, I urge you to read this article, which may help explain how American history and the founding fathers have been glorified.

- July 7, 2020 - [@ronnie_lee post on data bias](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCXUDaOD22i/?igshid=fd3wcvkcqgur)
  - Data bias is such a prevalent issue in society today. Even if we push for social reform to help make certain institutions more equal or fair, bias still exists, making it difficult to create effective reform. In this post, @ronnie_lee provides some simple examples of bias in everyday products including cars. She also includes several other resources to read because this Instagram post isn't a comprehensive article, but I think it still accurately shows how many racial or gender biases are engrained into our society.
