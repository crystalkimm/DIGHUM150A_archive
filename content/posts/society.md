- April 29, 2020 - [Medium article on how Amazon is unethical](https://onezero.medium.com/its-now-100-unethical-to-shop-on-amazon-48d553181a6c)
  - I'll admit, I am an avid Amazon user; I can buy almost any product I want by tapping my screen, and I can expect it to arrive at my doorstep in about three days. It's convenient and a lot of items are cheaper or in bulk. While this all seems great, there is a harsh truth that Amazon mistreats their employees. There are some alternatives to Amazon to support (https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/amazon-alternatives), but even then, Amazon's prices tend to be unbeatable. It may be difficult to stop using Amazon, but I hope I will try to shop from alternatives so as to try to not actively support a company that has unethical practices.
