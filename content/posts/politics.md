  - As a college student, this ICE policy is so relevant to me, not because I am an international student, but because I know there are so many students who will not have the choice to stay in their home country or return to school in the U.S. I know that students at UC Berkeley are trying to create more in-person classes during our hybrid semester to help out these international students, but there is no guarantee in allowing all international students who want to be in the U.S. to stay.
