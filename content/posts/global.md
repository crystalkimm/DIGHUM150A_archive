  - I saw posts trying to raise awareness of China's internment camps in April, and they didn't gain a lot of attention. Now, in August, there are still thousands of Muslims being held in these camps. Merdan Ghappar senta a video of himself in his cell to his family, which was released to raise awareness. This may endanger Ghappar, but I hope people begin to understand the severity of these camps and why we need to help free these individuals.
