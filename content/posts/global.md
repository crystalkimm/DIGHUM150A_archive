  - Lebanon has been suffering through an economic crisis before the pandemic, but COVID-19 has made their situation significantly worse. With severe inflation, many people cannot afford to buy food and other nessecary goods. At this point, this food crisis may require foreign aid to revive the country in its current status.

### August
- August 4, 2020 - [BBC article on Uighur interment in China](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53650246)
  - I saw posts trying to raise awareness of China's internment camps in April, and they didn't gain a lot of attention. Now, in August, there are still thousands of Muslims being held in these camps. Merdan Ghappar senta a video of himself in his cell to his family, which was released to raise awareness. This may endanger Ghappar, but I hope people begin to understand the severity of these camps and why we need to help free these individuals.
