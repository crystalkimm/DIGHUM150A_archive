- June - [1619 podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/podcasts/1619-slavery-anniversary.html)
  - In 2019, New York Times released 1619, a podcast about the history of slavery in America. Reflecting on recent events with the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement, 1619 reached Apple Podcasts's top charts in June. I haven't listened to it yet, but I thought I would include this because this podcast one of many forms of media that helps educate the public on the history of Black lives and how it affects racism today.
