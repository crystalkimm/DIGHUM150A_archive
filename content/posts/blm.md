- June 2, 2020 - [Oprah Magazine article listing Black-owned businesses to support](https://www.oprahmag.com/life/a32731286/black-owned-businesses/)
  - Since the beginning of the pandemic, people have been trying to support small/local businesses. With the publicity of the BLM movement, more people have been advocating to support Black-owned businesses. This is an article from Oprah Magazine that lists several Black-owned brands to shop, and there are many more resources readily available to find more businesses to support. This is also a great alternative to always buying from large corporations that may not have ethical or eco-friendly practices.

  - [@evelinabarz](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBRA5qfF_7S/?igshid=zi0zt4jbkuic), along with so many other artists, created visuals like this as quick information to consume. This specific image is just  a few of the many Black lives who have died due to the injustices of our country. It's important to learn and share their stories to make their voices heard.

  - It can be hard to find what media to consume and how to educate yourself on such heavy topics. Netflix created a BLM collection that shares stories of Black individuals. I watched When They See Us last year, and watched it again with my family recently, and it hit hard both times. Although these movies and shows can be very educational, it is important to note that not all these stories about Black lives (whether they are in this collection or not on Netflix at all) may not be directed by Black filmmakers, and may not be accurately reflective of their stories.

  - These trends help contextualize the rush of the Black Lives Matter movement that was initiated by the murder of George Floyd. The plots are based on surveys, and therefore are biased, but they are still a representation of how Americans view the BLM movement and protests. The visualizations show how different races are discriminated against and how current politics affects racism, but most importantly highlights the political polarity of the country.

- June 1 - June 15, 2020 - [1619 podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/podcasts/1619-slavery-anniversary.html)
  - In 2019, New York Times released 1619, a podcast about the history of slavery in America. Reflecting on recent events with the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement, 1619 reached Apple Podcasts's top charts in June. I haven't listened to it yet, but I thought I would include this because this podcast one of many forms of media that helps educate the public on the history of Black lives and how it affects racism today.
