## Background
As 2020 has progressed, more political and social issues have come to public attention. With the surge of activism from the Black Lives Matter movement, people have been using this momentum to raise awareness to these many issues ranging from systemic racism within the United States to the horrors of the fast fashion industry. I want this website to serve as a compilation of current events that I have seen throughout media. Using social media posts, blogs, and news articles, I plan to organize some of the political and social issues that I want to share. This project was highly inspired by Instagram accounts such as [@soyouwanttotalkabout](https://www.instagram.com/soyouwanttotalkabout/?hl=en) and [@shityoushouldcareabout](https://www.instagram.com/shityoushouldcareabout/?hl=en). Keep in mind, this archive does not contain all important news articles, but is rather a reflection of the media that I consume and was affected by. I hope this website makes people want to learn more about similar issues, educate themselves, and share opinions and thoughts with others.
